A helper library that makes it easy to create pull requests.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pr_comet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pr_comet

## Usage

```ruby
# Initialize.
pr_comet = PrComet.new(base: 'master', branch: '{branch name}')

# Modify arbitrary files and commit into the block.
pr_comet.commit '{commit message}' do
  file = File.read('path/to/file')
  file.sub!('hoge', 'fuga')
  File.write('path/to/file', file)
end

# You can also change files outer the block.
`bundle update`
pr_comet.commit '$ bundle update'

# Create a new pull request.
pr_comet.create!(
  title: 'New pull request',
  body: '{New pull request body}',
  labels: ['label 1', 'label 2'] # optional
)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
